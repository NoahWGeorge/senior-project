# senior-project
During my time researching and developing ideas for what to do with my senior project I had to think of ideas that not only would play into my strengths but also could challenge me into learning new languages and libraries. With that being said, I have decided to design a website that displays art pieces that you can buy, sell, view, and even just upload to gather feed back on. During the making of this site, I plan to use languages and frameworks such as HTML, CSS, NodeJS, react, and TypeScript while also incorporating detailed security measures to be able to store credit card information and account information. 

Through the home page I you will see a navbar which contains links to the about page and the gallery page, when you scroll down you will be able to see a showcase of NFT cards that are clickable to send you to OpenSea where the user could actually purchase these items. Lastly, when the user scrolls all the way down, they are able to see a footer with links to my GitHub and LinkedIn. Through the navbar the user can also click on the shopping cart icon which takes them to a shopping cart UI as if the user did in fact add them to their cart. Next the user will see a dropdown menu where they would be able to see NFT’s they liked, ability to sign in/up, and view the setting of their account. If the user were to click on the gallery page they would be able to search different NFT collections and have them show up on the bottom when the search is executed and also be able to click on these NFT’s to be redirected to the OpenSea site where they could purchase them. Lastly, the user could click in the about me page where they would see my interest in digital art and a couple pieces of my own art that I have created.
